# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

```One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.```

For this week's Challenge, the HTML tags were changed to semantic elements and some aria-labels were added to increase accessibility. This will also aid in any further updates by making a document that is clean and in which the flow is easy to read.

## CSS

The CSS file was also restructured so that elements and classes are grouped together by where they fall in the document structure.
